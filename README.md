# Venice social-ecological model 

This GitHub repository contains the data, code, and output for:
Elsler, L., 2015. Venice Ventures: modeling social-ecological co-evolution for resilience (MSc Thesis). University of Graz, Graz, Austria. Universitá Ca' Foscari, Venice, Italy. [link](https://online.uni-graz.at/kfu_online/wbAbs.showThesis?pThesisNr=59817&pOrgNr=1&pPersNr=50874)

Here's a quick run down of the files that assemble the input data and where this data is saved:
    
    CODE - A folder containing the code used to analyze the processed data and prepare tables/figures
           * parameters.py - file containing parameter names and values
           * routines.py - file containing model-required functions 
           * initialcon.py - initial configuration of variables
           * model.py - contains model and simple set of plots
           * fig_simulations.py - plots model simulations
           * fig_saltmarsh_equil.py - supplementary figure for salt marsh equilibrium 

    DATA - A folder containing secondary data from model processing
    
    FIGURES - A folder containing a selected set of figures from the thesis


ComTrade and Squid fishery landings data files containing the squid market price and catch volumes are very large (>500MB) and are not included in the repository. Please email Laura Elsler (l.elsler AT outlook.com) to request access to these files.
